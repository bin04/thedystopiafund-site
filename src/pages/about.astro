    <h1>About The Dystopia Fund</h1>

    <div class="card content">
      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        The Dystopia Fund is a satirical project that tracks U.S. government contracts awarded to companies
        profiting from surveillance, detention, border enforcement, and military operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every day, billions of taxpayer dollars flow to companies building the infrastructure of a surveillance
        state. We believe this spending should be transparent, trackable, and yes—mockable.
      </p>

      <h2>The Dystopia Score™</h2>
      <p>Each contract is assigned a proprietary "Dystopia Score" based on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Keywords:</strong> surveillance, biometric, detention, border, military, etc.</li>
        <li><strong>Agency:</strong> DHS, ICE, DOD, Border Patrol get bonus points</li>
        <li><strong>Contract Value:</strong> Bigger contracts = higher scores</li>
        <li><strong>Public Company:</strong> Traded dystopia gets extra points</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Data Source</h2>
      <p>
        All contract data comes from <a href="https://sam.gov" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SAM.gov</a>,
        the official U.S. government procurement database. We don't make this stuff up—your tax dollars really
        are funding this.
      </p>

      <h2>Who Made This?</h2>
      <p>
        Built by concerned citizens with too much time and not enough faith in government spending priorities.
        Powered by n8n, Supabase, Astro, and dark humor.

      <h2>Legal Disclaimer</h2>
      <p>
        This is satire and social commentary. The Dystopia Fund is not a real investment fund. We are not
        providing financial advice. We don't actually want you to profit from human suffering, but if you did,
        tracking government surveillance contracts would be a good start.
