        There's an uncomfortable truth embedded in modern capitalism: human suffering is extraordinarily profitable.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Dystopia Fund exists as both commentary and experiment: if these patterns are real, they should produce measurable alpha. 
        If profiting from social dysfunction is genuinely lucrative, then a portfolio explicitly designed around that thesis should 
        outperform—and that outperformance itself becomes evidence of how deeply inverted our incentive structures have become.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">The Thesis</h2>
      <p>
        When civil unrest erupts, surveillance companies see their stock prices surge. When immigration becomes a crisis, 
        private detention centers expand their contracts. When economic anxiety spreads, predatory lenders multiply their revenues.
      </p>

      <h2 class="text-2xl font-bold text-white mt-8 mb-4">Performance</h2>
      <p class="mb-4">5-Year Backtest (October 2020 - September 2025):</p>
      <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-6">
        <li><strong class="text-white">Dystopia 50 Portfolio:</strong> +227.2%</li>
        <li><strong class="text-white">S&P 500 Benchmark:</strong> ~89%</li>
        <li><strong class="text-green-400">Outperformance:</strong> +138.2 percentage points</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The portfolio didn't just beat the market—it more than doubled the market's returns. This wasn't achieved through 
        conventional growth investing or value plays. It was achieved by identifying companies whose business models 
        explicitly benefit from societal breakdown.
